[Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/) in the largest and unique platform for academic curriculumns. In there you can find information about the academic work of **ALL** Brazilian scholars. It is an unique and reliable source of information for bibliometric studies. 

I've been working with Lattes data for some time. Here I present a short list of papers that have used this data.

-  [The Brazilian scientific output published in journals: A study based on a large CV database](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157716301559)
- Predatory publications in the Brazilian academic system: an empirical analysis (Working paper)
- [The researchers, the publications and the journals of Finance in Brazil: An analysis based on resumes from the Lattes platform](http://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/ojs/index.php/rbfin/article/view/47157)    
- [Análise do Perfil dos Acadêmicos e de suas Publicações Científicas em Administração (in Portuguese)](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1415-65552017000100062)

Package `GetLattesData` is a wrap up of the functions that I've been using for acessing this dataset. It's main innovation is the possibility of downloading data directly from Lattes, without any kind of manual work. 

You can find an example of usage in the [vignette](TODOLINK in CRAN).
